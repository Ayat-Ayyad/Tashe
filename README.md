# Tasheh Ø·Ø´Ø©
#### Welcome to our Java Spring project ðŸŒž 


**Tasheh** allows users to browse through many interesting day-trips around Palestine. Families and friends can join to have fun visit lots of different places and do many types of activities.

This platform is much needed especially during the time of *Covid-19*. Tasheh facilitates joining fun activities to stop people from feeling trapped during lock-downs while also staying safe and being back home before the night lock down!

We believe this website will be a profitable business as well as an effective way to providing support to our local market and internal tourism.



**Main features:**

1. Users can **browse** many different types of day-trips.
2. They can also **join** the trips they like.
3. Users can view lots of info about the trip; such as **activities**, **price**, **date**, and a brief **description** about the landmarks to be visited.
